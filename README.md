# neoxa-block-scaper

Useful script to log all block on Neoxa blockchain.

Download the repository, install the requirements, rename the .csv to "neoxa_block_log.csv" and run "scraper.py".

# The idea 
The idea for this repository came about when I compared the pooled amount of Neoxa mined at [Neoxa 2Miners.com Pool](https://neox.2miners.com/)  with the amount of blocks found, that you can see in their API. The summary is that if I mined solo I earned more. So I wondered what number of blocks I had mined, but searching the internet I couldn't find anything that looked for the block miner, so I thought I'd create this one.
